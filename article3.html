            Bengaluru, the IT capital of India with around 10 million populations, has emerged as the world's fastest-growing mature tech ecosystem since 2016,
             followed by the European cities of London, Munich, Berlin and Paris.
             India's financial centre Mumbai has ranked sixth, as per the new research released in London on 14 January.
             <br>
             Dealroom.co data analysed by London & Partners – the Mayor of London’s international trade and investment agency – reveals that 
             investment in the Karnataka capital of Bengaluru grew 5.4 times from $1.3 billion in 2016 to $7.2 billion in 2020, with the Maharashtra 
             capital of Mumbai growing 1.7 times from $0.7 billion to $1.2 billion in the same period, 
             reported news agency PTI.<br></br>

         Bangalore is a modern city attracting both Indians from across the country and expatriates from around the world. While it’s still working out how to manage the population influx, it’s the talented and ambitious workforce that will
          help it continue to grow into a dynamic and forward-looking city.
         While the increasing number of unicorns are signalling that the Indian ecosystem is maturing, tech hub Bangalore still has quite a trek before
          it makes a name for itself as a global startup paradise
