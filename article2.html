            Tesla is finally coming to India with their electric cars. If things go well, there will be a lot of electric cars on the streets very soon. But, how much do we know so far?
            Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, on December 28, said that the electric car manufacturer would be arriving in India ‘early’ in 2021. 
            However, the company will first start with sales and then look assembly if the demand requires it.
            <br>
            Tesla and India have had a few go arounds already.
             Back in 2016, bookings for the Tesla Model 3 had begun, 
             but citi8ng infrastructure issues, everything fell apart. The Model 3 sedan will still be the first car to enter India and this will be done through the completely built unit (CBU) route. This however does mean higher import costs, but if the company uses the 2,500 unit limited import, prices could be slashed significantly. 
            This will mean a price difference of Rs 55-60 lakh at full cost and Rs 35-40 lakh under the limited import route.
