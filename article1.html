            This month saw another revolution in computing. This time Apple has done it without its chief storyteller Steve 
            Jobs, and that is maybe why the Apple Silicon M1 has not captured as much attention as some previous Apple 
            breakthroughs. Which is why it is important to understand the significance of this new processor from Cupertino.
        <br>
        M1 is here. Apple first chip designed specifically for Mac, it delivers incredible performance,
         custom technologies and revolutionary power efficiency. And it was designed from the very start
         to work with the most advanced desktop operating system in the world, macOS Big Sur. With a giant 
        leap in performance per watt, every Mac with M1 is transformed into a completely different class of product.
         This isn’t an upgrade. It’s a breakthrough.

         UPTO 3.9x FASTER VIDEO PROCESSING<br>
         UPTO 7.1x FASTER IMAGE PROCESSING<br>
         The M1 has four high-performance Firestorm and four energy-efficient Icestorm cores, providing a configuration 
         similar to ARM DynamIQ and Intel's hybrid Lakefield and Alder Lake processors.
